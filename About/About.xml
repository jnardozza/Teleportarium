    Adds Imperial Teleportarium technology to RimWorld:
    
    - Build Teleportarium Platforms (2x2 and 3x3) to send pawns and items across the map or between maps.
    - Construct a Teleportarium Cogitator (manned control station) to operate the platforms. Requires power and a pawn to man the cogitator.
    - Equip pawns with Teleport Homers to recall them (and nearby items/pawns) back to a platform from anywhere in the world.
    - Teleportation requires a power-up sequence, drains extra power, and can fail if energy is insufficient.
    - All teleportation and recall actions are gated behind research and require advanced components.
    - Includes custom sound effects and UI for teleportation and recall.
    
    Buildings added:
    - Teleportarium Platform (2x2)
    - Large Teleportarium Platform (3x3)
    - Teleportarium Cogitator (control station)
    
    Equipment added:
    - Teleport Homer (apparel for recall)
    
    Use the cogitator to activate teleportation or recall equipped pawns. Requires power, a manned cogitator, and a linked platform on the same power network.
